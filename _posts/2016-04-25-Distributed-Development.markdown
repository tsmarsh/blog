## Standup

Distributed standup is really easy, you just use a service like
[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com) or
[Zoom](https://zoom.us).

You also want to make sure everyone can see the wall. If you are using
a web based tool for your wall this is really easy.

There are rules:

* If one person is dialing in, everyone must dial in. 
* If you are dialing in you must have a decent headset
* If you are in the same room as someone else on the call you must
  mute yourself when you are not talking
  
Thats about it.

## Retrospective

Similar to standup, but I've found that tools like
[IdeazBoard](http://ideazboard.com) are great for simulating post-its
on a whiteboard. You can also get away with just a shared document,
like a Google Doc.

I would avoid high friction tools like Confluence that resist mulitple
editors... or editting in general. 

## Radiators

Most of the radiators I've seen are just websites anyway. Just make
sure they're available to everyone. 

Some teams I've been on prefer to push actual notifications in to a
channel in whatever chat room software you are using. Whilst I like
that, I still prefer having a page where I can see the state of all of
the projects I'm responsible for instead of having to figure it out by
reading an event log. 

## Watercooler

A shared chat program like [Slack](https://slack.com),
[HipChat](https://hipchat.com) or IRC is essential. The trick is
making sure that its accessible outside of your network, and
preferably from either your text editor (most text editors have
support for jabber / IRC) or have a web interface. This is just to
make sure that everyone, even those people who insist on using Windows
can contribute. 

Encourage silly rooms like "Cuteness" or "Random" and allow anyone to
create any room they like. Teams form in these rooms.


## Overhead conversations

I've experimented with open channels, having an audio or video feed
open at all time, with little or no success. The problem I find is
that can't do what I do in the real world and change the volume of
individuals by moving myself around the room.

One of the more successful rules was "Every question has to be asked
on X", where X is the chat program you're using, or dropping the audio
channel and having all meetings in open chat rooms. But that can add a
lot of overhead where what we're trying to do is reduce conversational
friction. 

I honestly haven't found a good alternative to being in the
same room (but I used to say that about pairing)

## Planning / Design

I've come up with a couple of tricks that work well.

### Cell phone cameras

For small sketches where you are desperately reaching for a
whiteboard, draw on on paper, take a picture and share with the room.
You can then choose to print it out, or edit it, or just recreate with
paper and send back. Its a process that works surprisingly well

### Video Whiteboard

Use a webcam, which can be the one in your laptop, and have a stream
of you drawing on a whiteboard. Relies on everyone having a
whiteboard. Honestly, if you are working from home I'd seriously
consider making sure everyone has access to a whiteboard. 

### Online Whiteboards

Almost universally bad. Avoid. 

## Pairing

That I'm leaving to a different post.
