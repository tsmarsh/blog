Blogging from my phone is nothing new. I've been connecting my trusty
[K760](http://support.logitech.com/en_gb/product/wireless-solar-keyboard-k760-for-mac)
for a while. But... apps. I was as excited as anyone when Steve Job's
introduced the idea of mobile apps. I like small, single purpose
applications that do one thing well, but that thing is rarely text
entry. 

Screen keyboards are a lot better than
[T9](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)), but that
really doesn't say very much, and they're ok compared to physical
phone keyboards, but, honestly they suck. So we've built apps around
the idea that people aren't going to type, or, do anything really.

Our phones are really very passive devices. They're neat cameras,
touch is ok, and their screens are high quality, but just really,
really small compared to out laptops, but compared to our laptops from
10 years ago, they're amazing, and compared to computers, real
computers from 30 years ago they are unimaginally powerful.

So.

So what happens when we treat our 2016 phones like 1986 desktop
computers. 

Turns out, really, really good things.

First up [Termux](https://termux.com). My Android phone is a linux
kernal wrapped in a pretty useful GUI, termux peels away the GUI and
leaves me witha very useful terminal emulator.

This is all well and good. It allowed me to ssh into my servers, neat
but not exactly worth carrying a keyboard around for. 

But recently it got Emacs.
[Emacs!](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). The one true editor. To
Emacs, my phone is like a palace. It was first created when 80
charactors was widescreen, when 256 colours was 254 too many colours.
Emacs, an editor who's one true purpose is to be the true interface to
every single text file you have ever edited. And its not Emacs 'lite',
its full emacs, so full that I can use
[Outpace Starter Kit](https://github.com/outpace/emacs.d), which is
what I use every day for real software developement.

Not only can I edit text files, termux also has
[git](https://git-scm.com), and [tmate](https://tmux.github.io) so I
can share text files and pair with people, just like a 'real'
computer. 

So, here I am, editing a blog on a device that fits in my pocket, on a
full sized [keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k480),
that weighs next to nothing, and has a cute slot for my phone to stand
in and I have editting power comparable to my beloved MacBook Pro
(which doesn't have built in LTE). 

It is not ok to call this the future. There is nothing novel about using
small, under powered computers for text editing. But I do feel that it
drives home, once again, that investing time in learning a technology
like terminal emulators, ssh and emacs/vi is rarely time wasted.

Now then only problem is that the lovely screen in my phone is almost
as useless in daylight as my laptop... I wonder if I can get emacs
running on a kindle.
